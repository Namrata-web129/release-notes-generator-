# Python Project

This is a Python project with a virtual environment.

## Setup

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run your Python scripts.

## Troubleshooting

- If `python` command not found, ensure Python is installed and added to PATH.
- If activation fails, check the virtual environment path.
